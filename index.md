**JSON Schema** is a vocabulary that allows you to **annotate** and **validate** JSON documents.


## Advantages

<div class="block" style="float:left;width:50%;" markdown="1">

### JSON Schema

* Describes your existing data format(s).
* Provides clear human- and machine- readable documentation.
* Validates data which is useful for:
    * Automated testing.
    * Ensuring quality of client submitted data.

### JSON Hyper-Schema

* Make any JSON format a hypermedia format with no constraints on document structure
* Allows use of [URI Templates](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) with instance data
* Describe client data for use with links using JSON Schema.
* Recognizes collections and collection items.

## Project Status

### Update as of 27 May 2019

**The forthcoming draft is in [final review](work-in-progress).**

This draft has also taken more time than expected because it tackles deep, long-term issues that have long been a challenge for JSON Schema.  This includes building in a formal extensibility mechanism so that we can more easily draw a line to finalize the contents of the Core and Validation specifications.

Additionally, numerous life issues reduced the availability of key contributors during the process.

### The Path to Standardization

The JSON Schema project intends to shepherd all four draft series to RFC status.  Currently, we are continuing to improve our self-published Internet-Drafts. The next step will be to get the drafts adopted by an IETF Working Group.  We are actively investigating how to accomplish this.

If you have experience with such things and would like to help, please contact us!

In the meantime, publication of Internet-Draft documents can be tracked through the IETF:
* [JSON Schema (core)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-handrews-json-schema/)
* [JSON Schema Validation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation/)
* [JSON Hyper-Schema](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-handrews-json-schema-hyperschema/)
* [Relative JSON Pointers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-handrews-relative-json-pointer/)

Internet-Drafts expire after six months, so our goal is to publish often enough to always have a set of unexpired drafts available.  There may be brief gaps as we wrap up each draft and finalize the text.

The intention, particularly for vocabularies such as validation which have been widely implemented, is to remain as compatible as possible from draft to draft.  However, these are still drafts, and given a clear enough need validated with the user community, major changes can occur.

## Quickstart

The JSON document being validated or described we call the *instance*, and the document containing the description is called the *schema*.

The most basic schema is a blank JSON object, which constrains nothing, allows anything, and describes nothing:

```json
{}
```

You can apply constraints on an instance by adding validation keywords to the schema. For example, the "type" keyword can be used to restrict an instance to an object, array, string, number, boolean, or null:

```json
{ "type": "string" }
```

JSON Schema is hypermedia ready, and ideal for annotating your existing JSON-based HTTP API. JSON Schema documents are identified by URIs, which can be used in HTTP Link headers, and inside JSON Schema documents to allow recursive definitions.
